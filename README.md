# Hotel-Buddy
This C language console application is designed to facilitate hotel bookings based on customer requirements. It includes three user roles: the customer, the admin, and the hotel representative.

The customer can explore a wide range of hotels, comparing prices, locations, and services offered. They can make informed decisions and book the hotel that best fits their needs. Additionally, customers have the ability to rate the hotel they booked, providing valuable feedback for other users.

The admin has full control over hotel and customer records. They can manage and update hotel information, monitor ratings, and oversee the entire system. The admin also earns a 5 percent commission on the total bill from each hotel booking.

Hotel representatives can update their rates, available services, and room availability. They have the ability to offer discounts to customers by providing promo codes. Additionally, hotel representatives can view their average ratings given by customers, enabling them to gauge their performance and make necessary improvements.

Overall, this console application provides a user-friendly platform for customers to find suitable hotels, allows admins to manage the system effectively, and empowers hotel representatives to update their information and offer personalized services.
